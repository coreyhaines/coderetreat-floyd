        <h2>What is a Code Retreat?</h2>
        <p>A free weekend retreat for software developers that want to hone their craft together.
          It is an opportunity for coders to retreat from production and the pulls of business to increase production capacity and quality, resulting in improved personal and business value when they return.<br/><br/>
          Sponsoring a code retreat is an opportunity to support the skills of the developer community at a fundamental level.
