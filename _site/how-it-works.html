  <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>

  <h2>What Is Code Retreat</h2>
  <p>The idea for code retreat was spawned at the January, 2009, <a href="http://codemash.org/">Codemash Conference</a> by Patrick Welsh, Nayan Hajratwala and me, Corey Haines. The idea was to develop a repeatable, day-long event that was focused on practicing the fundamentals of software development. The first event was held in Ann Arbor, MI, not long after the conference.</p>
  <p>Through the course of 2009, many retreats were held, including several international ones in Iceland and Romania. The format for the day evolved over the year, based on the concrete experiences of the facilitators. While the choice of facilitator has an effect on the details of the day, the over-arching recipe remains the same.</p>

  <h2>How I Run Code Retreats</h2>
  <p>Through 2009, I ran several retreats, both alone and with co-facilitators. We've seen certain things work and certain things that don't work. The following recipe has become my preferred formated for running code retreats:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Problem: Conway's Game of Life (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_game_of_life">link to wikipedia</a>)</li>
    <li>Length of Session: 45 minutes</li>
    <li>Duration: 8am to 5 or 6pm</li>
    <li>Language: traditionally Java, although intended audience is key.</li>
    <li>After: Go out and have some drinks</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pair-programming is necessary, as the knowledge transfer contained in that activity is essential to the practice;</li>
    <li>After each session, pairs should be swapped;</li>
    <li>After each session, code must be deleted, not put in a branch, not stashed, just deleted with no trace left;</li>
    <li>Prefer using Test-Driven Development (TDD);</li>
    <li>Introduce TDD As If You Meant It (<a href="http://gojko.net/2009/02/27/thought-provoking-tdd-exercise-at-the-software-craftsmanship-conference/">explanation</a> - <a href="http://gojko.net/2009/08/02/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it-revisited/">another explanation</a>)</li>
    <li>Lunch should be something good, catered. My rule is that if you are willing to come out at 8 in the morning to spend the day coding, you deserve more than just pizza for lunch.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Time Breakdown</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>8 - 8.30am    : arrival, breakfast</li>
    <li>8.30 - 9am    : welcome, introductions, explanation of the problem</li>
    <li>9 - 9.45am    : Session #1</li>
    <li>9.45 - 10am   : retrospective, break</li>
    <li>10 - 10.45am  : Session #2</li>
    <li>10.45 - 11am  : retrospective, break</li>
    <li>11 - 11.45am  : Session #3</li>
    <li>11.45 - 12pm  : retrospective, break</li>
    <li>12 - 1.30pm   : lunch, socializing (optional: lightning talks, presentations)</li>
    <li>1.30 - 2.15pm : Session #4</li>
    <li>2.15 - 2.30pm : retrospective, break</li>
    <li>2.30 - 3.15pm : Session #5</li>
    <li>3.15 - 3.30pm : retrospective, break</li>
    <li>3.30 - 4.15pm : Session #6</li>
    <li>4.15 - 4.30pm : retrospective, break</li>
    <li>4.30 - 5pm    : final retrospective on day, discussion</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Optional Session #7</h3>
  <p>After 6 sessions, people are usually pretty tired from an unusually intense day of coding. Sometimes people are charged up to go another sessions, sometimes they feel like they want to spend the remainder of the time talking, socializing. If everyone is up for doing a 7th session, then hold the final retrospective until after that.</p>

  <h3>What To Do In Each Session</h3>
  <h4>Sessions 1 and 2:</h4>
  <p>Allow pairs to get a feel for the problem domain. Not everyone has seen Conway's Game of Life before, so these two sessions allow them to wrap their head around the task. After the first session, it can sometimes be useful to discuss the idea of deleting the code. Some people might have a bit of resistance to the idea. Gently explain that those are the rules.</p>

  <h4>Session 3:</h4>
  <p>Introduce the idea of TDD As If You Meant It. This gives a focus for people to practice the very fundamentals of TDD, similar to running scales when working with a musical instrument.</p>

  <h4>Lunch (recommended):</h4>
  <p>Facilitator and experienced pairing partner show an example of doing TDD As If You Meant It on a similar problem.</p>

  <h4>Sessions 4, 5 and 6:</h4>
  <p>Continue to practice the fundamentals of TDD. If some pairs wish to look at other aspects of the problem, it is certainly permitted. The thing to remember is that the goal is not to finish the problem, but, rather, to find a particular part of development to practice.</p>

  <h2>Why Java?</h2>
  <p>The point of the code retreat is not to learn a new language. In fact, it isn't really about learning something new at all. It is about practicing the techniques of development. Java was chosen as the standard language, because it has one very important quality: almost anyone can code in it. Most people have written in a C-based language, and Java is fairly simple for the domain we are working in.</p>

  <p>Doing other languages is okay, as long as the attendees know ahead of time that it won't be in Java. This will allow people to decide whether they are comfortable enough in the language to participate. It is important to let people know that there won't be time for setting up environments, learning the language, etc.</p>
