<h1>What Is Code Retreat</h1>
<p>
Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.

Spending a day participating in a coderetreat is an ideal way to increase your development team's skills. Leveraging my experience as the leading facilitater of trainings using the coderetreat format, I now am available for hire to lead <a href="/training.html">private in-company trainings</a>.
For an in-depth understanding of the philosophy behind a day of coderetreat, please watch this introduction video.

<p>After attending and facilitating more than 20 code retreats, I've become convinced that it is a valuable way to disseminate the idea and implementation of focused practice. I've seen the effect of attending a code retreat on people, and I want to share a proven formula for running one. <br/><br/>-- Corey Haines</p>
