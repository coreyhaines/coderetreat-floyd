<h2>History of Coderetreat</h2>
<p>The idea for code retreat was spawned at the January, 2009, <a href="http://codemash.org/">Codemash Conference</a> by Gary Bernhardt, Patrick Welsh, Nayan Hajratwala and me, Corey Haines. The idea was to develop a repeatable, day-long event that was focused on practicing the fundamentals of software development. The first event was held in Ann Arbor, MI, not long after the conference.</p>
<p>Through the course of 2009, many retreats were held, including several international ones in Iceland and Romania. The format for the day evolved over the year, based on the concrete experiences of the facilitators. While the choice of facilitator has an effect on the details of the day, the over-arching recipe remains the same.</p>
<p>Through 2010, I embarked on a coderetreat tour with the goal of facilitating 10 code retreats around the world. Along the way, I shared the formula and facilitation techniques, so that others could learn to effectively facilitate their own. This supported the ideal that the more skilled facilitators there are, the more coderetreats that can successfully reach their full potential.</p>
<p>In 2009, I travelled around the country, pair-programming in exchange for room and board. I spent the year learning and teaching, developing and sharing the ideas of the Software Craftsmanship Movement. After attending and facilitating many code retreats, I've become convinced that it is a valuable way to disseminate the idea and implementation of focused practice. I've seen the effect of attending a code retreat on people, and I want to share a proven formula for running one. <br/><br/>-- Corey Haines</p>
<p>For the first year, we pushed single-language coderetreats, generally using Java as the language. It was chosen for one simple reason: almost anyone could code in it. There were coderetreats, though, held in different languages, most notably Ruby, but they were always single-language.</p>
<p>In Romania, though, they had different ideas. They didn't stick to the single-language format and looked at what would happen if people did it in whatever language they wanted. So, at a single coderetreat, you might have people doing it in C#, some in Java, some in Python and perhaps a few in PHP. Since introducing Maria and Alex to the idea of coderetreat in May of 2009, the Romanians went wild and started having coderetreats all the time. When I went back to facilitate one in February, 2010, it became clear that they had some great learnings to share. We dropped the 'single-language' rule that I usually go with and went with their standard multi-language version. It worked great!</p>
<p>Learning from them, I've dropped the general 'single-language' rule and am more than happy to have multiple languages happening side-by-side. I stress that it is important the languages are fairly main-stream, or at least familiar to both members of the pair, otherwise one person could get a bit confused on syntax, which brings us back to the whole 'coderetreat is not about learning a new language' idea.</p>
