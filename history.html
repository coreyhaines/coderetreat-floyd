<h2>History of Coderetreat</h2>
<p>The idea for code retreat was spawned at the January, 2009, <a href="http://codemash.org/">Codemash Conference</a> by Patrick Welsh, Nayan Hajratwala and me, Corey Haines. The idea was to develop a repeatable, day-long event that was focused on practicing the fundamentals of software development. The first event was held in Ann Arbor, MI, not long after the conference.</p>
<p>Through the course of 2009, many retreats were held, including several international ones in Iceland and Romania. The format for the day evolved over the year, based on the concrete experiences of the facilitators. While the choice of facilitator has an effect on the details of the day, the over-arching recipe remains the same.</p>
<p>Through 2010, I embarked on a coderetreat tour with the goal of facilitating 10 code retreats around the world. Along the way, I shared the formula and facilitation techniques, so that others could learn to effectively facilitate their own. This supported the ideal that the more skilled facilitators there are, the more coderetreats that can successfully reach their full potential.</p>
