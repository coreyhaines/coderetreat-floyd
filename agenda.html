<h3>Optional Session #7</h3>
<p>After 6 sessions, people are usually pretty tired from an unusually intense day of coding. Sometimes people are charged up to go another sessions, sometimes they feel like they want to spend the remainder of the time talking, socializing. If everyone is up for doing a 7th session, then hold the final retrospective until after that.</p>

<h3>What To Do In Each Session</h3>
<h4>Sessions 1 and 2:</h4>
<p>Allow pairs to get a feel for the problem domain. Not everyone has seen Conway's Game of Life before, so these two sessions allow them to wrap their head around the task. After the first session, it can sometimes be useful to discuss the idea of deleting the code. Some people might have a bit of resistance to the idea. Gently explain that those are the rules.</p>

<h4>Session 3:</h4>
<p>Introduce the idea of TDD As If You Meant It. This gives a focus for people to practice the very fundamentals of TDD, similar to running scales when working with a musical instrument.</p>

<h4>Lunch (recommended):</h4>
<p>Facilitator and experienced pairing partner show an example of doing TDD As If You Meant It on a similar problem.</p>

<h4>Sessions 4, 5 and 6:</h4>
<p>Continue to practice the fundamentals of TDD. If some pairs wish to look at other aspects of the problem, it is certainly permitted. The thing to remember is that the goal is not to finish the problem, but, rather, to find a particular part of development to practice.</p>
