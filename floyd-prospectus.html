        <h2>What is a Code Retreat?</h2>
        <p>A free weekend retreat for software developers that want to hone their craft together.
          It is an opportunity for coders to retreat from their normal work environment to hone certain skills that they may be unable to focus on during their normal work setting.<br/><br/>
          Sponsoring a code retreat is an opportunity to support the skills of the developer community at a fundamental level.
