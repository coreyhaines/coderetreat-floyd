Along with community-oriented events, I am also available for private, in-company trainings for your team. The coderetreat format can help improve your team's overall skills. Coderetreat's focus on pair-programming, test-driven development and modular design enhances a team's ability to provide the following values:
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced ability to incrementally improve legacy codebases, resulting in lower cost of ownership and change when working on a long-lived codebase;</li>
  <li>Increased knowledge sharing among team members, countering the risk of small 'bus numbers';</li>
  <li>Improved experience and skills building loosely-coupled, modular systems.</li>
</ul>
Private coderetreat trainings are an effective follow-up or alternative to traditional, in-class training or conferences.
