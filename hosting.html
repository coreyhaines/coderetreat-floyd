<h1>Hosting</h1>
<p>
The host is responsible for securing a location and enough sponsorship to ensure a productive, comfortable and free event for attendees. If you are interested in hosting a coderetreat, feel free to <a href="mailto:coreyhaines+coderetreathosting@gmail.com">contact me</a> for more information and help.
</p>

<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
To host a coderetreat, only a few guidelines need to be followed.
<ul>
  <li>Coderetreat lasts for a day</li>
  <li>Event must be free, funded by sponsors</li>
  <li>A facilitator is found to guide the participants through the day</li>
  <li>Lunch should be something good, catered; my rule is that if you are willing to come out at 8 in the morning to spend the day coding, you deserve more than just pizza for lunch</li>
</ul>
</p>
