<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>Here are some other resources for organizing and hosting a coderetreat.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alex Bolboaca has been organizing and facilitating an ongoing series of coderetreats in Romania. He wrote a great post on <a href="http://www.alexbolboaca.ro/wordpress/articles/how-to-organize-a-code-retreat">organizing coderetreats.</a></li>
  <li>John Smith has a great post on the specifics of <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/onefloridacoder/archive/2010/08/16/setting-up-for-the-orlando-code-retreat.aspx">what to think about when organizing a coderetreat.</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pair-programming is necessary, as the knowledge transfer contained in that activity is essential to the practice;</li>
  <li>After each session, pairs should be swapped;</li>
  <li>After each session, code must be deleted, not put in a branch, not stashed, just deleted with no trace left;</li>
  <li>Prefer using Test-Driven Development (TDD);</li>
  <li>Introduce TDD As If You Meant It (<a href="http://gojko.net/2009/02/27/thought-provoking-tdd-exercise-at-the-software-craftsmanship-conference/">explanation</a> - <a href="http://gojko.net/2009/08/02/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it-revisited/">another explanation</a>)</li>
  <li>Lunch should be something good, catered. My rule is that if you are willing to come out at 8 in the morning to spend the day coding, you deserve more than just pizza for lunch.</li>
</ul>
